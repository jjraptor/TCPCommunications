This is the intial design and prototype for an application to command and control a remote SDR transceiver.
I have used it with Elecraft K4, KPA1500 an Kenwood TS-890.
Very basic UI design used to very capabilities using SwiftUI
The TCP communictions were programmed using the Apple Network framework in Swift.
