Explanation
TCPConnectionManager Class:
Manages the TCP connection using NWConnection.
Handles connecting, sending data, and receiving data.
Uses a DispatchQueue for network operations.
Publishes received data to update the UI.
ContentView Struct:
Provides a user interface to interact with the TCP connection manager.
Allows input for host, port, and message.
Connects, sends messages, and disconnects using buttons.
Displays received data.
This setup should give you a basic TCP client in a SwiftUI app using Apple's Network framework. You can expand on this by adding more error handling, support for different data formats, or additional UI elements as needed.
